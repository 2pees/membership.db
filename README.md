# Membership Database Schema

> Membership database schema boilerplate for
> [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/),
> [SQL Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/),
> [Oracle](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/), and [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/).
> It is optimized for use in web applications where you need high
> interoperability between data model(s) and JavaScript objects (see
> [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/)). The database contains everything you need to
> store user account information, user roles, and authentication tokens /
> claims. Feel free to use it either as a boilerplate when starting a new web
> application project, or simply as a reference implementation.
